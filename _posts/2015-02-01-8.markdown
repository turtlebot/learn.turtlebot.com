In addition to its cliff sensors and bumpers, Kinect is one of the ways TurtleBot “sees” its environment. We’ve already [installed the drivers for Kinect]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-01-5 %}) so now we’ll test it to make sure it works.

## Test Driver and USB Connection (TurtleBot Only)

On TurtleBot, close all terminals, then open a new window and run:

{% highlight sh %}
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch 
{% endhighlight %}

Then open another terminal window and run:

{% highlight sh %}
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch 
{% endhighlight %}

If you get a collection of lines that start with `process[camera...` everything is perfect and you can skip the troubleshooting section below and move on to the “View Image Data” section. Leave the two terminal windows open.

## Troubleshooting

If you repeatedly receive:

{% highlight sh %}
[INFO][#]: No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected
{% endhighlight %}

this is probably because the Kinect driver wasn’t installed. [See Install Kinect Driver in our previous post]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-01-5 %}).

If you receive:

{% highlight sh %}
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'openni_wrapper::OpenNIException' 
{% endhighlight %}

or

{% highlight sh %}
Image: PrimeSense/SensorV2/5.1.2.1: Failed to set USB interface!
{% endhighlight %}

these have occurred because Kinect isn’t compatible with USB 3.0. Plug it into a USB 2.0 port. (Problems can also occur with USB 2.0 ports that are 3.0 compatible.).

#### Troubleshooting: I don't have a USB 2.0 port or it's still giving the above errors

We're going to disable USB 3.0 in the BIOS.

1. Boot into BIOS by rebooting your computer and holding down the F2 key (it could be a different key on your computer).
2. Go to the *advanced* tab.
3. This part varies depending on your computer. If you have a USB option go there first.
4. If your BIOS lists **xHCI**, disable it.
5. If you BIOS lists **USB Debugging**, enable it.
6. Save and exit BIOS.

#### If you still have trouble, check that the Kinect has power by running:

{% highlight sh %}
lsusb
{% endhighlight %}

and verify that there are three lines about `Microsoft Corp.`, two of which are regarding `XBox NUI`. If you only have one line or none, Kinect may not be plugged in or is lacking power.

## View Image Data (Workstation)

Close all terminal windows, open a new one, and run:

{% highlight sh %}
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_color
{% endhighlight %}

You should see a live video stream from the Kinect. Press ‘q’ to quit.

This is not much more exciting than a webcam, so let’s see a visual representation of distance by running:

{% highlight sh %}
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/depth/image
{% endhighlight %}

You should see a grayscale video stream where objects closer to the Kinect appear darker.

***TIP:** If you see only solid gray, check that you are still running openni.launch on TurtleBot.*

Press ‘q’ to quit the depth image.

## Stop Openni (TurtleBot)

Go to the terminal on TurtleBot where **openni** is running. Press ctrl + C to stop it. Leave **minimal.launch** running. Now run:

{% highlight sh %}
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch
{% endhighlight %}

{% include youtube.html youtubeid="-eGh2QJF398" youtubetitle="3dsensor.launch" %}

## RViz (Workstation)

Close all terminal windows, then open a new one and run:

{% highlight sh %}
roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_robot.launch
{% endhighlight %}

Under “Displays” check “Registered DepthCloud” and “Image”. Hold down the left mouse button to rotate or the middle mouse button to move the camera.

***NOTE:** If you don’t see the display panel, scroll your mouse to the top of the screen and click “Panels”. Check the box next to “Display Panel” to enable it.*

If you have trouble, here’s a YouTube walkthrough:

## Troubleshooting

If you get a warning about “no image available”, try closing everything on both TurtleBot and workstation and then re-opening.
