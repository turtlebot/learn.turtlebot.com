Now that TurtleBot [can go to a specific location]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-01-14 %}), we want to make sure it doesn’t run out of battery power. In an earlier article we discussed [auto-docking TurtleBot]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-02-01-12 %}) , so if TurtleBot knows when the batteries are low, it can autonomously charge itself.

## Monitoring the Netbook’s Battery Status.

### ROS Topics

ROS has a concept called “topics”. These topics are a lot like conference call lines. You can continuously listen to a conference line and whenever something is said on the line you can do something via a callback function. There is a “conference line” of sorts for the netbook’s battery status. You can listen to it and know every time the netbook’s battery increases or decreases charge.

### Listing all Topics

ROS & TurtleBot’s libraries publish lots of topics. Let’s have a look at a complete list of them. On TurtleBot, open a terminal window and run:

{% highlight sh %}
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
{% endhighlight %}

On the workstation, open a terminal window and run:

{% highlight sh %}
rostopic list
{% endhighlight %}

The above will give us a list of current topics. You should see `/laptop_charge`, which gives us information about the netbook’s battery. Let’s trying listening to it:

{% highlight sh %}
rostopic echo /laptop_charge
{% endhighlight %}

Every second you’ll see a collection of information about the netbook’s battery including charge, percentage, charge state (1 == it’s charging, 0 == it’s not) and more.

{% include youtube.html youtubeid="MpMN-8EyVmc" youtubetitle="/laptop_charge/ battery status" %}

## Writing Code to Monitor the Netbook’s Battery Status

If you haven’t cloned the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/markwsilliman/turtlebot/), do that first.

{% highlight sh %}
cd ~/helloworld/
python netbook_battery.py
{% endhighlight %}

Press *ctrl + c* to stop it. Now let’s have a look at the code.

{% include youtube.html youtubeid="BN3s1vheHoU" youtubetitle="Script to Monitor the Netbook's Power Status" %}

In the terminal window type and run:
{% highlight sh %}
gedit netbook_battery.py
{% endhighlight %}
You can also [view it on GitHub](https://github.com/markwsilliman/turtlebot/blob/master/netbook_battery.py) if you prefer.

You’ll notice in the initialize function there is:
{% highlight sh %}
rospy.Subscriber("/laptop_charge/",SmartBatteryStatus,self.NetbookPowerEventCallback)
{% endhighlight %}

This means, “Every time new data is published on the thread `/laptop_charge/` call the function `self.NetbookPowerEventCallback`.”

`SmartBetteryStatus` is the data type which the thread contains. This data type is defined in the include command (found near the top of the script):

{% highlight sh %}
from smart_battery_msgs.msg import SmartBatteryStatus
{% endhighlight %}

Now let’s have a look at the function `NetbookPowerEventCallback`. The data is passed to the function and the components can be printed like this:

{% highlight sh %}
print("Percent: " + str(data.percentage)) 
{% endhighlight %}

***IMPORTANT TIP:** Later on we’ll check if `data.percentage` is larger than 50 to see if we need to recharge. Python is very strict when it comes to comparing different types of data so always type cast using `int()`. Example:*

{% highlight sh %}
if (data.percentage < 50):
{% endhighlight %}

*would result in an error but:*

{% highlight sh %}
if(int(data.percentage) < 50):
{% endhighlight %}

*will work perfectly.*
